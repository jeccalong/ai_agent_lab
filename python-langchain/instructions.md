Python LangChain AI Agent - Student Lab Instructions
Prerequisites
Before starting this lab, ensure you have the following installed:

Python (Version 3.9 or higher)

Download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Verify installation: python --version or python3 --version
Verify pip: pip --version or pip3 --version
Visual Studio Code

Install the "Python" extension from the VS Code marketplace
Install the "GitHub Copilot" extension
GitHub Models Access

Sign in to GitHub with your account
Visit https://github.com/marketplace/models
Find and select the gpt-4o model from OpenAI
Click "Get started" or "Deploy" to enable the model for your account
Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with the following steps:
Navigate to Developer Settings: In GitHub, click your profile photo, go to Settings, then click Developer settings in the left sidebar
Select Fine-grained Tokens: Under "Personal access tokens", select Fine-grained tokens and then click Generate new token
Configure Token Details: Give the token a descriptive name (e.g., "GitHub Models Access") and set an expiration period (recommended for security)
Select Repository Access: Choose whether the token can access all repositories or only specific ones. For security, it is best to select "Only select repositories" and choose the minimal number needed
Add Permissions: Under the "Permissions" section, find the Models permission under "Account permissions" and set its access level to Read
Generate and Save: Click Generate token at the bottom of the page. Immediately copy the token and store it in a secure location, as you will not be able to see it again
Or use your GitHub Copilot subscription which includes access to GitHub Models
Create .gitignore File

Download the Python .gitignore template from GitHub:
Visit: https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore
Click "Raw" button and save the content to a .gitignore file in your project root
Or use this direct link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Python.gitignore
Important: Verify that .env is included in the .gitignore (it should be by default)
This prevents committing sensitive data (like your GitHub token) and generated files to version control
Create .env File

Create a .env file in the project root directory (this should already be in your .gitignore)
Add your GitHub token: GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
Replace your_token_here with your actual GitHub Personal Access Token
Important: Never commit this file to version control - verify it's listed in .gitignore

Lab Exercise: Building an AI Agent with Python and LangChain
Part 1: Project Setup
Prompt 1: Create Requirements File

Create a requirements.txt file for a Python LangChain AI agent application that includes:
- langchain
- langchain-openai
- langchain-core
- python-dotenv
Prompt 2: Create Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

Create a Python virtual environment named 'venv' and provide the commands to:
- Create the virtual environment
- Activate it (show commands for both Windows and Linux/Mac)
- Install the dependencies from requirements.txt
Prompt 3: Create Basic App Structure

Create an app.py file that:
- Has the necessary imports for dotenv
- Has a main() function
- Calls main() when the script is run directly (using if __name__ == "__main__")
- Includes a starting message with emoji
Prompt 4: Create VS Code Configuration

Create VS Code tasks.json and launch.json for the python console application in the python-langchain folder.
Part 2: Basic Application Setup (Without Tools)
Prompt 5: Load Environment Variables

In app.py, add code to:
- Import and load environment variables using dotenv
- Check if GITHUB_TOKEN exists in environment variables
- Display an error message with helpful instructions if the token is not found
- Return early if no token is found
- Include helpful user feedback with emoji
Prompt 6: Initialize ChatOpenAI Model

Add code to:
- Import ChatOpenAI from langchain_openai
- Create a ChatOpenAI instance that uses:
  - model="openai/gpt-4o"
  - temperature=0 for deterministic responses
  - base_url="https://models.github.ai/inference"
  - api_key from the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable
Prompt 7: Test Basic Query (Without Tools)

Add code to:
- Import necessary classes for creating a simple agent
- Create a test query: "What is 25 * 4 + 10?"
- Call llm.invoke() with the query
- Print the response content
- Note: The AI will try to answer on its own without tools
Test Point: Run the application with python app.py. You should see the AI attempt to answer the math question, but it may not be accurate since it doesn't have access to calculation tools.

Part 3: Adding Tools and Agent
Prompt 8: Import Agent and Tool Classes

Update the imports to include:
- create_agent from langchain.agents
- Tool from langchain_core.tools
- datetime from the datetime module
Prompt 9: Create Calculator Tool Function

Before the main() function, create a calculator function that:
- Takes a string input parameter
- Has a docstring explaining it evaluates mathematical expressions
- Uses Python's eval() to evaluate the expression (with safety considerations for demo purposes)
- Includes try-except error handling
- Returns the result as a string
Prompt 10: Create Tools List with Calculator

After initializing the LLM in main(), create a tools list with:
- A Tool object for the calculator
- Use name="Calculator"
- Use the calculator function as func
- Include a detailed description explaining when to use it
Prompt 11: Create Agent with Calculator Tool

Add code to:
- Create an agent using create_agent()
- Pass the llm and tools list
- Set debug=True for verbose output
- Create a test query: "What is 25 * 4 + 10?"
- Use agent_executor.invoke() with a dictionary containing the input query
- Print the result['output']
- Wrap in try-except for error handling
Test Point: Run the application again. Now the AI should use the Calculator tool to accurately calculate "What is 25 * 4 + 10?" and return 110. You should see debug output showing the tool being called.

Prompt 12: Test Time Query (Without Tool)

Replace the math query with a new query: "What time is it right now?"
Comment out the Calculator tool from the tools list
Run the application and observe that the AI cannot provide the current time accurately
Test Point: Run the application. The AI will not know the current time since it doesn't have access to system time.

Prompt 13: Create Time Tool Function

Before the main() function, create a get_current_time function that:
- Takes a string input parameter (required by Tool interface)
- Has a docstring explaining it returns the current date and time
- Uses datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
- Returns the formatted string
Prompt 14: Add Time Tool to Tools List

Add a Tool object to the tools list that:
- Has name="get_current_time"
- Uses the get_current_time function as func
- Has a description explaining when to use it
- Keep the Calculator tool in the list as well
Test Point: Run the application. Now the AI should use the get_current_time tool to provide the current time.

Prompt 15: Test String Query (Without Tool)

Replace the query with: "Reverse the string 'Hello World'"
Comment out both the Calculator and Time tools
Run the application and observe that the AI attempts to reverse the string but may not be reliable
Test Point: Run the application. The AI will try to reverse the string on its own, which may not be perfect.

Prompt 16: Create String Reversal Tool Function

Before the main() function, create a reverse_string function that:
- Takes a string input parameter
- Has a docstring explaining it reverses a string
- Returns the reversed string using Python slice notation [::-1]
Prompt 17: Add String Tool to Tools List

Add a Tool object to the tools list that:
- Has name="reverse_string"
- Uses the reverse_string function as func
- Has a description: "Reverses a string. Input should be a single string."
- Ensure all three tools are uncommented (Calculator, get_current_time, reverse_string)
Test Point: Run the application. The AI should use the reverse_string tool to accurately reverse the string and return "dlroW olleH".

Prompt 18: Create Multiple Test Queries

Replace the single query with a list of test queries:
- "What time is it right now?"
- "What is 25 * 4 + 10?"
- "Reverse the string 'Hello World'"

Add a for loop that:
- Prints "Running example queries:" before the loop
- Iterates through each query
- Prints the query with formatting (📝 emoji and separator line)
- Calls agent_executor.invoke() for each query
- Prints the result with formatting (✅ emoji)
- Includes try-catch error handling for each query (❌ emoji for errors)
Test Point: Run the application. All three queries should now work accurately using their respective tools. You should see debug output showing which tool is being called for each query.

Prompt 19: Improve Output Formatting

Update the output formatting to:
- Use print("─" * 50) for separator lines
- Add newlines for better spacing between queries
- Add a completion message at the end: "🎉 Agent demo complete!"
Prompt 20: Add System Message

Update the agent initialization to include a system message that instructs the AI to be professional and succinct. Add this configuration when creating the agent.
Part 4: Final Testing
Testing Instructions:

Run the application with all three tools enabled. You should observe:

Time queries return accurate current time via get_current_time tool
Math calculations are precise via Calculator tool
String reversal is correct via reverse_string tool
The AI seamlessly chooses and uses the appropriate tool for each query
Debug output shows the agent's reasoning and tool selection
Expected Output
When running with all tools enabled and debug mode, you should see output similar to:

Final Assessment
Test your understanding by completing this assessment:

Weather Tool with Multi-Function Calling
Objective: Create a Weather Tool that demonstrates the AI's ability to chain multiple function calls together.

Requirements:

Create a Weather Tool function that:

Takes a string input parameter (date in format "YYYY-MM-DD")
Has a docstring explaining it returns weather information for a given date
Returns "Sunny, 72°F" if the date matches today's date (use datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d"))
Returns "Rainy, 55°F" for all other dates
Include proper error handling
Add the tool to your tools list:

Create a Tool object with name="get_weather"
Use the weather function as func
Include a detailed description explaining it accepts a date parameter (formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD")
Keep the get_current_time tool in the tools array as well
Test with a query that requires two function calls:

Ask the AI: "What's the weather like today?"
The AI should:
First call get_current_time() to get today's date
Then call get_weather with that date to get the weather
Return a complete answer combining both pieces of information
Success Criteria:

The AI successfully chains two function calls without explicit instruction
Mock weather data is returned based on the current date
The response is coherent and answers the original question
Discussion Questions
After completing the lab, consider:

What's the difference between responses with and without tools?
Why are tools important for AI agents?
How does LangChain orchestrate the tool calls?
What is the role of the create_agent function in this architecture?
How does Python's simplicity compare to JavaScript and Java for building AI agents?
Extension Challenges
If you finish early, try:

Additional Tools
Create a WeatherTool function that returns mock weather data for a given city
Add a FileTool that can read/write text files using Python's built-in file operations
Create a WebSearchTool that simulates web search results
Add conversation memory to maintain context across multiple interactions using ConversationBufferMemory
Cross-Cutting Concerns (Use Copilot to Help!)
Logging & Observability 5. Add comprehensive logging throughout the application

Log all AI requests and responses
Log tool calls with parameters and results
Use Python's logging module with different log levels
Include timestamps and log levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR)
Ask Copilot: "Add logging using Python's logging module to track AI interactions and tool calls"
Performance Monitoring 6. Add performance metrics and timing

Measure response time for each AI query
Track tool execution duration using time.time()
Log slow queries (over a threshold)
Ask Copilot: "Add performance monitoring to track query response times"
Error Handling & Resilience 7. Implement robust error handling

Add retry logic with exponential backoff for API failures
Handle rate limiting scenarios gracefully
Provide detailed error messages to users
Use custom exception classes
Ask Copilot: "Add retry logic with exponential backoff for AI API calls"
Input Validation 8. Add input validation and sanitization

Validate user queries before sending to AI
Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks
Set maximum query length limits
Use type hints for better code clarity
Ask Copilot: "Add input validation to sanitize and validate user queries"
Security Improvements 9. Improve the calculator function's security

Replace eval() with a safer alternative like ast.literal_eval or a math parser library
Implement whitelist of allowed operations
Add input validation for mathematical expressions
Ask Copilot: "Replace eval() with a safer method for evaluating mathematical expressions"
Handling Rate Limit Responses (HTTP 429) 10. Handle rate limiting responses from the API - Detect and catch HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) errors - Parse retry-after headers from the response - Implement automatic retry after the specified delay - Display user-friendly messages when rate limited - Ask Copilot: "Add handling for HTTP 429 rate limit responses with automatic retry"

Key Differences from Java and JavaScript
As you work through this lab, you may notice some key differences compared to other language implementations:

Virtual Environments: Python uses virtual environments (venv) for dependency isolation, while JavaScript uses node_modules and Java uses Maven
Simplicity: Python's syntax is often more concise—string reversal is [::-1] vs JavaScript's split("").reverse().join("")
Tool Definition: Python uses simple functions with docstrings, while Java uses annotations and JavaScript uses object literals
Type System: Python is dynamically typed (though type hints are available), while Java is statically typed and JavaScript/TypeScript can be either
Agent Creation: Python uses create_agent(), JavaScript uses initializeAgentExecutorWithOptions(), Java uses Semantic Kernel's plugin system
All three frameworks accomplish the same goal—building AI agents with tool calling—but leverage the strengths and idioms of their respective languages.

Troubleshooting
Common Issues:

"ModuleNotFoundError": Make sure your virtual environment is activated and you ran pip install -r requirements.txt
"GITHUB_TOKEN not found": Verify your .env file is in the correct directory and contains the token
Virtual environment activation issues:
Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Linux/Mac: source venv/bin/activate
API errors: Check that your GitHub token is valid and has proper permissions
eval() security warnings: This is expected for demo purposes; see Extension Challenge #9 for safer alternatives
